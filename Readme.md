# Genetic algorithms for face recognition

Genetic algorithms for face recognition adjusting faces with ellipses. 

## Requirements
You need the following in order to run the project:
- Python 2.7
- PIL library
- CV libray

## Algorithm

<<<<<<< HEAD
Before to start the GA,  we applied the following steps:
=======
Previous start of genetic algorithms, the following Image Treatment was applied:
>>>>>>> parent of 43923f5... changes readme
* Convert RGB Image to grayscale
* Change the image size to 256x256 
* Image noise reduction
* Apply Canny algorithm 

Then the genetic algorithm was applied adjusting faces with ellipses. (More details at Reporte.pdf)


## Sample output

With 15 generations and 100 individuals, I got the following result:
